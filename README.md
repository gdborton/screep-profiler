# Screeps Profiler [ ![Codeship Status for gdborton/screeps-profiler](https://codeship.com/projects/bd2a3c50-e9f2-0132-f68f-4602e60b2e9f/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/83021)

The Screeps Profiler is a library that helps to understand where your CPU is being spent in the game of [Screeps](https://screeps.com).

It works by monkey patching functions on the Global game object prototypes, with a function that record how long each function takes.  The primary benefit of using this profiler is that you can get a clear picture of where your CPU is being used over time, and optimize some of the heavier functions.  While it works best for players that heavily employ prototypes in their code, it should work to some degree for all players.

## Setup

### Installation

You have two options for installing this script.  You can either use npm and a compiler like webpack, or you can copy/paste the `screeps-profiler.js` file and use the provided screeps require function.

### Main.js

Your main.js will will need to be configured like so.

```javascript
// Any modules that you use that modify the game's prototypes should be require'd
// before you require the profiler.
var profiler = require('screeps-profiler');

// This line monkey patches the global prototypes.
profiler.enable();
module.exports.loop = function() {
  profiler.wrap(function() {
    // Main.js logic should go here.
  });
}
```

## Usage

You can make use of the profiler via the Screeps console.  Currently there are three commands that are available for use.

```javascript
Game.profiler.profile(ticks, [functionFilter]);
Game.profiler.stream(ticks, [functionFilter]);
Game.profiler.email(ticks, [functionFilter]);
```

**Note:** It can take up to 30 ticks if you're using `module.exports.loop` for these commands to work without issue.

`profile` - Will run for the given number of ticks then will output the gathered information to the console.

`stream` - Will run for the given number of ticks, and will output the gathered information each tick to the console.  The can sometimes be useful for seeing spikes in performance.

`email` - This will run for the given number of ticks, and will email the output to your registered Screeps email address.  Very useful for long running profiles.

In each case, `ticks` controls how long the profiler should run before stopping, and the optional `functionFilter` parameter will limit the scope of the profiler to a specific function.

## Example output

Below is a sample output of `Game.profiler.profile(1000)`

```

```

Seeing that `Spawn.work` is high, we might run `Game.profiler.profile(200, 'Spawn.work')` to see what about `Spawn.work` is taking so long.  From that we would get:

```

```

**Note:** each function recorded here was part of a call stack with `Spawn.work` at the root.

## Registering functions

Many players in screeps do not utilize the Global prototypes that are available.  The profiler supports arbitrary functional code as well, but takes a bit more work to setup.
In order to do it, you'll need to import the profiler wherever you want to register a function, then call the registerFN method.  This will take two parameters, the first is the function that you want to profile, the second is the name that you'd like to call the function in the output.  The registerFN method is recursive, so it will add all of the
functions underneath the main function you are registering.

**Example:**

```javascript
var profiler = require('profiler');
function getAllScouts () {
  return Object.keys(Game.creeps).filter(function(creepName) {
    var creep = Game.creeps[creepName];
    return creep.memory.role === 'scout';
  });
}

// Be sure to reassign the function, we can't alter functions that are passed.
getAllScouts = profiler.registerFN(getAllScouts, 'mySemiOptionalName');
```

**Note:** the second param is optional if you pass a named function `function x() {}`, but required if you pass an anonymous function `var x = function(){}`.

## Potential Overhead

There is some work to setting up the functions for profiling.  While this work is kept to a minimum when the profiler is not in use, it may be beneficial to comment out or remove the `profiler.enable()` call when you know you aren't going to be using it.  This will revert the monkey patched functions to their original functions.
